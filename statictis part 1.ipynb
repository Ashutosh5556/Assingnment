    "Measures of Central Tendency: Mean, median, and mode, which describe the center of a data set.\n",
    "Measures of Variability: Range, variance, and standard deviation, which describe the spread or dispersion of a data set.\n",

    "Example:\n",

This type of statistics uses probability theory to determine the likelihood that conclusions drawn from a sample are valid for the entire population.\n",

    "Usage: Provides a measure of the spread of data points around the mean. It is more interpretable than variance because it is in the same units as the original data.\n",
    "Example: For exam scores, after calculating the variance, take the square root to find the standard deviation, which indicates the average distance of scores from the mean."
