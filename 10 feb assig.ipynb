    "Read Mode ('r'): This mode opens a file for reading only. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file. If the file does not exist or cannot be found, it raises an error.\n",
    "Write Mode ('w'): This mode opens a file for writing only. It will create a new file if it does not exist, and if it exists, it will truncate it, i.e., erase all existing data. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file.\n",
    "Append Mode ('a'): This mode opens a file for writing. The file pointer is placed at the end of the file. Any data written to the file is automatically added to the end. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file.\n",
    "Read and Write Mode ('r+'): This mode opens a file for both reading and writing. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file.\n",
    "Write and Read Mode ('w+'): This mode opens a file for reading and writing. It will create a new file if it does not exist, and if it exists, it will truncate it. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file.\n",
    "Append and Read Mode ('a+'): This mode opens a file for reading and appending. The file pointer is placed at the end of the file. New data is written to the end of the file.\n"

    "The close() function is used to close a file after it has been opened and used in a program. It's important to close a file for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Release Resources: When a file is opened, the operating system allocates certain resources to handle the file, such as memory space and file descriptors. If the file is not closed properly, these resources may not be released, leading to resource leaks. Closing the file ensures that these resources are freed up and can be used by other parts of the program or by other programs running on the system.\n",
    "Flush Buffers: When data is written to a file, it is often first stored in memory buffers before being physically written to the disk. Closing the file ensures that any remaining data in these buffers is flushed (written) to the file before it's closed. This ensures that all data is written to the file and nothing is left pending in memory.\n",
    "Prevent Data Corruption: Closing a file properly helps prevent data corruption or loss. For example, if a file is not closed properly and the program terminates unexpectedly, there's a risk that some data may not have been fully written to the file, leading to corruption or loss of data.\n",
    "Release Locks: In some operating systems, files may be locked while they are open, preventing other programs from accessing or modifying them. Closing the file releases these locks, allowing other programs to access the file if needed."

    "The with statement in Python is used in conjunction with file I/O operations, particularly with the open() function, to ensure that the file is properly closed after its suite (block of code) finishes execution, regardless of whether an exception is raised or not. This is known as the context management protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why using the with statement with open() is advantageous:\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic Resource Management: The with statement automatically takes care of opening and closing the file. When the code inside the with block finishes executing (either normally or due to an exception), the file is automatically closed, ensuring proper resource management. This eliminates the need for explicit calls to file.close() and reduces the risk of resource leaks.\n",
    "Error Handling: If an error occurs during file operations within the with block, the with statement ensures that the file is still properly closed before propagating the exception, helping to prevent file corruption or data loss.\n",
    "Conciseness and Readability: Using the with statement makes the code more concise and readable by clearly indicating the scope in which the file is being used. It eliminates the need for repetitive boilerplate code for opening and closing files.\n",
