    "An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.

    "REST (Representational State Transfer) Architecture\n",
    "Key Principles of REST:\n",
    "Stateless: Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server does not store any client context between requests.\n",
    "Client-Server: The client and server operate independently, with the client initiating requests and the server responding to them.\n",
    "Cacheable: Responses from the server can be cached by the client or intermediary components to improve performance.\n",
    "Uniform Interface: RESTful systems adhere to a standard interface, which simplifies and decouples the architecture. This includes:\n",
    "Resource Identification: Resources are identified by URLs (Uniform Resource Locators).\n",
    "Resource Manipulation via Representations: Clients interact with resources using representations (e.g., JSON, XML).\n",
    "Self-descriptive Messages: Each message includes enough information to describe how to process it.\n",
    "Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS): Clients interact with resources through hypermedia provided dynamically by application servers.\n",
    "Layered System: The architecture can be composed of multiple layers, with each layer interacting only with the adjacent ones.\n",

    "SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) Architecture\n",
    "Key Features of SOAP:\n",
    "Protocol: SOAP is a protocol that defines a structured way to exchange information using XML.\n",
    "Extensibility: SOAP can be extended to include additional functionality, such as security (WS-Security) and transaction handling.\n",
    "Neutrality: It is platform and language-independent.\n",
    "Formal Contracts: Uses WSDL (Web Services Description Language) to define the contract for web services.\n",
    "Transport Independence: Although typically used with HTTP/HTTPS, SOAP can be transported over other protocols like SMTP, FTP, etc.\n",
    "Strict Standards: Adheres to strict standards and specifications defined by the W3C."
